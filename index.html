            <p> A properly maintained aquarium filter means cleaner water and healthier fish.
            You will need to replace your filter cartridge and perform a 25 percent water change every two to
            four weeks. You also need to vacuum the gravel thoroughly to remove any waste buildup. The easiest
            and most effective way to accomplish both a water change and a gravel cleaning is with a standard,
            siphon-operated gravel vacuum.</p>
            <p>Water that appears cloudy, yellowish or smells bad is telling you that your aquarium water needs
            changing and a new filter cartridge immediately. If the problem persists, it may be because you have
            too many fish — or because you’re overfeeding them. Bring a sample of your water to your dealer for
            testing. When replacing water in an aquarium, be sure to treat it first. Most tap water contains
            chlorine or chloramines, and adding untreated tap water to your tank could seriously harm your fish.
            Be sure to check with your dealer for the water dechlorinator that works best with your local tap
            water.</p>
